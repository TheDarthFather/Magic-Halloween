# Magic-Halloween
A Halloween config setup for the [Magic Minecraft Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/magic.1056/). This is a hard depencence and it will not work without.

**Instalation**

`mconfig example fetch halloween https://github.com/TheDarthFather/Magic-Halloween/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`

**Dependences:**

**Magic-Halloween resource pack** is needed for some custom models.
You have two options:
1. Download the pack from [here](https://download.mc-packs.net/pack/202f30d5c4852dbaa8d25243b55da8cc6fddeafb.zip) and merge it with the Magic Pack version of your choice.
2. Download an already merged pack between Magic-HiRess and MagicHalloween from [here](https://download.mc-packs.net/pack/4f3b3ec460b3a4a62a0ab7e8b30b7e5b7c7dfe06.zip)
Of course you need to merge it as well with your server pack if you have one.

**ModelEngine** is used for a few custom mobs.

Download the ModelEngine plugin and copy the mobs from [here](https://github.com/TheDarthFather/Magic-Halloween/tree/main/dependences/modelengine/blueprints) to the plugin blueprints folder
