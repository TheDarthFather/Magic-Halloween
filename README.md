# Magic-Halloween
A Halloween config setup for the [Magic Minecraft Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/magic.1056/). This is a hard depencence and it will not work without.

**Instalation**

`mconfig example fetch halloween https://github.com/TheDarthFather/Magic-Halloween/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`
`/mconfig example add halloween`

**Dependences:**

**1. Magic-Halloween resource pack** is needed for some custom models.
You have two options both available [here](https://github.com/TheDarthFather/Magic-Halloween/tree/main/dependences/resource-pack):
1. Download the MagicHalloweenRP pack and merge it with the Magic Pack version of your choice.
2. Download the  merged pack between Magic-HiRess and MagicHalloween.

Of course you need to merge it as well with your server pack if you have one. Great tool for this [here](https://merge.elmakers.com/)

**2. ModelEngine** is used for a few custom mobs.

Download the ModelEngine plugin and copy the mobs from [here](https://github.com/TheDarthFather/Magic-Halloween/tree/main/dependences/modelengine/blueprints) to the plugin blueprints folder

**3. LibDisquises** for mob disquises. 

**Unninstall**

`mconfig example halloween remove`

You may want to keep the RP after uninstall if your players got custom Halloween item/wands.
