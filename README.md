# Magic-Halloween
A Halloween config setup for the [Magic Minecraft Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/magic.1056/). This is a hard depencence and it will not work without.

**Instalation**

`/mconfig example fetch halloween https://github.com/TheDarthFather/Magic-Halloween/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`

`/mconfig example add halloween`

**Dependences:**

**1. Magic-Halloween resource pack** is needed for some custom models.
You have two options available:
1. Download the [MagicHalloweenRP](https://github.com/TheDarthFather/Magic-Halloween/blob/main/dependences/resource-pack/MagicHalloweenRP.zip) pack and merge it with the Magic Pack version of your choice.
2. Download the  [merged pack](https://download.mc-packs.net/pack/ad733ccf10d2f0a9bdb4d88e6cfe51a1322298e1.zip) between Magic-HiRess and MagicHalloween.

Of course you need to merge it as well with your server pack if you have one. Great tool for this [here](https://merge.elmakers.com/)

**2. ModelEngine** is used for a few custom mobs.

Download the ModelEngine plugin and copy the mobs from [here](https://github.com/TheDarthFather/Magic-Halloween/tree/main/dependences/modelengine/blueprints) to the plugin blueprints folder

**3. LibDisquises** for mob disquises. 


_**Uninstall**_

`/mconfig example halloween remove`

You may want to keep the RP after uninstall if your players got custom Halloween item/wands.
