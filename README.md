# Magic-Halloween
A Halloween config setup for the [Magic Minecraft Plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/magic.1056/). This is a hard depencence and it will not work without.

**Instalation**

`mconfig example fetch halloween https://github.com/TheDarthFather/Magic-Halloween/archive/master.zip`

**Dependences:**

**Magic-Halloween resource pack** is needed for some custom models.
You have two options:
1. Download the pack from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mNj3pvwTV2RN2Gi9rnwBnm5ez6cYzglg/view?usp=sharing) and merge it with the Magic Pack version of your choice.
2. Download an already merged pack between Magic-HiRess and MagicHalloween from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tv53aYoKXsDR8zPj-WLIk4cVEQVEUl5N/view?usp=sharing)
Of course you need to merge it as well with your server pack if you have one.

**ModelEngine** is used for a few custom mobs.
Download the ModelEngine plugin and copy the mobs from [here](https://github.com/TheDarthFather/Magic-Halloween/tree/main/dependences/modelengine/blueprints) to the plugin blueprints folder
